# Omics Data Analysis Repository

Welcome to the Omics Data Analysis Repository! This repository hosts a collection of projects and pipelines related to various omics fields, including transcriptomics, genomics, proteomics, and more. These projects cover a range of biological computations and analyses.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into different folders, each dedicated to a specific omics field or related projects. Here's an overview of what you can find:

### [Transcriptomics](./transcriptomics)

- In the "Transcriptomics" folder, you will find projects and pipelines related to the analysis of transcriptomic data. This includes differential gene expression analysis, pathway enrichment analysis, and more.

### [Genomics](./genomics)

- The "Genomics" folder contains projects focused on genomics data analysis. This may involve genome assembly, variant calling, and annotation.

### [Proteomics](./proteomics)

- Explore the "Proteomics" folder to find projects related to proteomics data analysis. This may include protein identification, quantification, and functional analysis.

### [Metabolomics](./metabolomics)

- The "Metabolomics" folder hosts projects related to the analysis of metabolomic data, which involves identifying and quantifying small molecules in biological samples.

### [Bioinformatics Pipelines](./pipelines)

- In the "Pipelines" folder, you can access various bioinformatics pipelines that are applicable across different omics fields. These pipelines streamline common biological computations and analyses.

## Project Descriptions

Each subfolder contains detailed README files and documentation specific to the projects or pipelines within that omics field. Feel free to explore the projects and pipelines that interest you the most.
